# bic-bot-py
bic-bot, except in python this time. it seems like discord.py is better for my purposes than discord.NET

Bic-Bot is a flexible Discord bot designed to be customizable for each server

Features include:
- customizable responses to given prompts
- translation by user-defined dictionaries
- image moderation based on user-defined image categories, classified by a TensorFlow model (currently not configurable by users)
- storing custom data for users within a server
